Basic Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) for columns like population, area, density, and growth rate.
Handling Missing Values:

Identify and handle missing values in the dataset, especially in population and area columns.
Population Growth Analysis:

Calculate the population growth over time for each country by comparing population values from different years.
Determine countries with the highest and lowest growth rates over specific intervals (e.g., 1970-2022).
Continental Analysis:

Group the data by continent to analyze average population, density, and area for each continent.
Top and Bottom Analysis:

Find the top 10 most and least populated countries, as well as those with the highest and lowest densities.
Percentage of World Population:

Analyze which continents contribute the most and least to the world population.
Correlations:

Compute correlations between variables like population, area, density, and growth rate to understand relationships within the data.


- See if any countries have an overall decrease on population, check different times, years.
