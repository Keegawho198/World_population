Basic Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) for columns like population, area, density, and growth rate.
Handling Missing Values:

Identify and handle missing values in the dataset, especially in population and area columns.
Population Growth Analysis:

Calculate the population growth over time for each country by comparing population values from different years.
Determine countries with the highest and lowest growth rates over specific intervals (e.g., 1970-2022).
Continental Analysis:

Group the data by continent to analyze average population, density, and area for each continent.
Top and Bottom Analysis:

Find the top 10 most and least populated countries, as well as those with the highest and lowest densities.
Percentage of World Population:

Analyze which continents contribute the most and least to the world population.
Correlations:

Compute correlations between variables like population, area, density, and growth rate to understand relationships within the data.


- See if any countries have an overall decrease on population, check different times, years.


Population Growth Trends

Which countries have experienced the highest and lowest growth rates over the past 50 years?

This can reveal both rapidly growing and shrinking populations, often correlated with economic, social, or political factors.

What is the average population growth rate by continent?

This could help identify global regions with high or low growth and could prompt deeper investigations into regional trends.

Are there any countries where growth rates have changed significantly in recent years?

Comparing recent growth rates (e.g., 2000–2022 vs. 1970–2000) can highlight emerging demographic shifts.



Demographic Declines and Aging Populations

Which countries have seen population declines in recent years?

This can identify countries with potential aging populations or emigration issues.


How does population density compare across regions and over time?

This would help to assess urbanization trends and whether population pressures are increasing in certain areas.

Are there common characteristics among countries with declining populations?

Finding correlations with GDP, urbanization, or other socioeconomic factors can explain declining population trends.



Global Share and Population Distribution

What percentage of the world population does each continent represent, and how has this changed over time?

This would highlight which continents are growing in global population share.


Which countries have the largest shares of the global population?

This could help assess where the world’s population is most concentrated and which countries might have increased influence.






Population Growth Over Time: How has the population of each country changed from 1970 to 2023? You can create line graphs to visualize growth trends over the years.

Annual Growth Rate: What is the annual growth rate of the population for each country or continent over specific periods? This can help identify periods of rapid growth or decline.

Comparative Growth Analysis: How does the population growth of one country compare to another over the years? This can highlight differences in demographic trends.

Population Milestones: What significant population milestones have occurred for each country (e.g., reaching a certain population size) between 1970 and 2023?

Impact of Historical Events: How have historical events (such as wars, migrations, or policy changes) impacted population growth in specific countries during this timeframe?

Urbanization Trends: How has urbanization affected population distribution in countries from 1970 to 2023? You can analyze shifts from rural to urban populations.

Demographic Changes: How have age distributions changed over the years in different countries? This can involve analyzing the proportion of youth versus elderly populations.

Population Projections: Based on historical data, what are the projections for future population growth in different countries or continents?

Correlation with Economic Indicators: How does population growth correlate with economic indicators (like GDP) over the years in various countries?

Visualizing Trends: Create visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, or animated maps to showcase population changes over time for better understanding.


FOR correlation 

Population Growth Rate: Calculate the growth rate of the population for each country between each decade (e.g., from 1970 to 1980, 1980 to 1990, etc.). You can then analyze the correlation between these growth rates across decades for different countries.

Decadal Changes: Compare the population figures from one decade to the next. For example, you can analyze how the population in 1980 correlates with the population in 1990 and see if there are consistent growth patterns.

Longitudinal Analysis: Examine how the population of a specific country has changed over the decades and correlate these changes with global events (if you have contextual data) to see if there are any observable trends.

Comparative Growth: If you have multiple countries, you can analyze the correlation of population growth between pairs of countries over the decades. This can help identify if countries with similar growth patterns exist.

Visualizing Trends: Create visualizations such as scatter plots to show the relationship between populations at different time points. This can help identify trends or clusters of countries with similar population dynamics.

Percentage Change: Calculate the percentage change in population for each country over each decade and analyze the correlation of these percentage changes between different countries.

Population Projections: If you have historical data, you can use it to project future populations and analyze how past growth rates correlate with projected growth.

Regional Analysis: If your data includes multiple countries, you can group them by region (e.g., continents) and analyze the correlation of population growth within those regions.
