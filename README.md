Basic Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) for columns like population, area, density, and growth rate.
Handling Missing Values:

Identify and handle missing values in the dataset, especially in population and area columns.
Population Growth Analysis:

Calculate the population growth over time for each country by comparing population values from different years.
Determine countries with the highest and lowest growth rates over specific intervals (e.g., 1970-2022).
Continental Analysis:

Group the data by continent to analyze average population, density, and area for each continent.
Top and Bottom Analysis:

Find the top 10 most and least populated countries, as well as those with the highest and lowest densities.
Percentage of World Population:

Analyze which continents contribute the most and least to the world population.
Correlations:

Compute correlations between variables like population, area, density, and growth rate to understand relationships within the data.


- See if any countries have an overall decrease on population, check different times, years.


Population Growth Trends

Which countries have experienced the highest and lowest growth rates over the past 50 years?

This can reveal both rapidly growing and shrinking populations, often correlated with economic, social, or political factors.

What is the average population growth rate by continent?

This could help identify global regions with high or low growth and could prompt deeper investigations into regional trends.

Are there any countries where growth rates have changed significantly in recent years?

Comparing recent growth rates (e.g., 2000–2022 vs. 1970–2000) can highlight emerging demographic shifts.



Demographic Declines and Aging Populations

Which countries have seen population declines in recent years?

This can identify countries with potential aging populations or emigration issues.


How does population density compare across regions and over time?

This would help to assess urbanization trends and whether population pressures are increasing in certain areas.

Are there common characteristics among countries with declining populations?

Finding correlations with GDP, urbanization, or other socioeconomic factors can explain declining population trends.



Global Share and Population Distribution

What percentage of the world population does each continent represent, and how has this changed over time?

This would highlight which continents are growing in global population share.


Which countries have the largest shares of the global population?

This could help assess where the world’s population is most concentrated and which countries might have increased influence.
